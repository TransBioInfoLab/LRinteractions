There are two steps to implement our LR hunting algorithm and reproduce the results of the TNBC data analysis. Two .R files match these two steps, named as “1_Multiple_Imputation.R” with dataset “LogNormalized_9types.data”, and “2_Ensemble_Results_Pvalues.R” with dataset “LRdb.RData”. The TNBC dataset that contains 7 patients of 9 cell types including "Myeloid", "Epithelial_Basal", "Endothelial", "Myoepithelial", "Epithelial_Luminal_Mature", "iCAFs", "myCAFs", "CD4+ T-cells", "T-Regs" are stored in “LogNormalized_9types.data”.
